# Database-Final

Project Idea:

While working for a sports network, I was responsible for operations, budgeting and logistics. With that, tracking cost was a part of my job and was quite difficult because we didn't have a database. For my project, I'd like to design a database that could've made my life a lot easier.
At the network, we produced national broadcasts from different places across the country. Sometimes we would visit a location once and sometimes we would revisit other locations. Games were produced by different companies and paid for by us. We also hired the on-air talent and paid for the logistic needs as well as their talent fees.
With this design, I should be able to do things like create reports that track how much a production at a given location will cost. With this information we can decide if producing games there are cost effective.
Overall, we did not have a way to create reports and run analytics to help us make better business decisions. With this database, I hope to fix that.

Data set:

For my project, I created the data using methods. You will also find that there are a couple of views that are created when selecting the option to create the data set. With this project, I tried to mock my real work scenario. The data is created randomly in a meaningful way. However, the talent and production tables will only have approximately 10 rows. This is deliberate. I did not work with hundreds of personnel or vendors, instead I worked with a select few as reflected in this project. On the other hand, the game table will 500 records and the budget view that is create will have approximately 1500 records.


Queries:

1. List the talent by first name who broadcasted a given game and what was the average cost of flights?
2. What company did a given game and what was the total cost of the production, including talent rates and production rates
3. Of the talent, who cost the most for the season?
4. Which production company made the cost the most money this season
5. Which location did we visit the most and how much did the logistics cost for that location?
6. Which location did we visit the least and how much did logistics cost for that location
7. Which distribution platform hosted the most games and what was the average cost for all games?
8. Which distribution platform hosted the least games and what was the average cost?
9. Which broadcast had the most fans who were the talents and production company
10. Which location had the cheapest flight costs and which had the most?
